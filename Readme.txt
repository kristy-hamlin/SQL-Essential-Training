SQL Essential Training Practice Project
Kristy Hamlin

This repository contains SQL Queries and screenshots created as part of my practice while taking the SQL Essential Training Course on LinkedIn Learning. I took Database Management 1 and 2 at Florida International University, so this course serves as a refresher for me. The goal of this project is to review SQL syntax and showcase my commitment to keeping relevant skills fresh.

COURSE BACKGROUND: 
This LinkedIn Learning course uses a sample SQLite database (not included in this repo due to licensing restrictions) provided as part of the course exercise files. The database represents a fictitious music store and contains tables such as Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, and others.

CONTENTS:
Queries - contains text files of queries executed
Screenshots - contains screenshots of the database structure, queries and results in DB Browser for SQLite.
